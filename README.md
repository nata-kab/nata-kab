#  About me

I learned programming under the supervision of a personal IT mentor. Now I am
looking for my first commercial job and I can start it right away.

I found that programming is like a puzzle that challenges me to solve the problem
and get all the parts to fit together. I'm always really excited to see the final result
of my work.
